---------------[[How to play]]-----------------------

My game is a bullet hell type game, you play as the fly and the objective is to survive as long as possible.

W,A,S,D are your movement keys
SPACE is your dash key

The dash gives you invulnerability for the time that you are dashing, so you can utilize it to dodge attacks.

---------------[[ The Objective ]]-------------------

Your main goal in this game is to survive, there is a score counter in the top left, try to get that as high as possible!
Score is given as you are currently alive, which means that longer that you stay alive, the more score you get.

You lose when your health goes to zero, so be careful!
This can only happen when you collide with projectiles or lazers so utilze your movment to avoid damage.
After you lose, your score for the run will be displayed.
